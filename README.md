  For Phase 1, our goal was to create a Physics Engine from Scratch in Java that simulates the Solar System, so we could plan a probe mission to Titan, one of Saturn's moons. To accomplish this task, we had to understand the Physics that governs the Solar System, that is, Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. However, solving this equation and determining the position of all celestial bodies after a given time involves solving second order differential equation to which an analytical solution is not known. Therefore, we had to implement an Euler's Solver, which can approximate the solution of differential equations numerically. Here is a picture of our GUI:
